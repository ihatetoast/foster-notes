# Foster Notes

## What
A simple NodeJS notes app with some extras to make this specific to keeping track of my greyhound fosters.

## Why
* For two years, I have had roles that did not have any Node fun. What fun is no Node fun, I ask ya!? As I brush up my Node skills, by following tutorials, I try to replicate but individualise to ensure I am not just copying but learning. 
* I have started to foster greyhounds again. Looking over my photo files from the aughts to early teens, I realise that I have photos but not always memories of each. I shouldn't feel bad. There were so many, but I do. I just wanted a little note app to remind me of a few characteristics and to be able to recall them by looking for color, name, sex. 

## Toolbox
* NodeJS
* Chalk to make it purty
